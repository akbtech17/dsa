// What is Spanning Tree ? 
// Connects all vertices of the Graph (V)
// with V-1 edges
// subsets of edges, that form a tree to connect all vertices 
// of the graph (with no cycle formed)
// It forms a Single Componenet

// What is Min Spanning Tree?
// ST with lowest cost is called MST.

// There are two algorithms which can be used to find MST in 
// Weighted Undirected Graph -
// 1 - Krushkal's Algorithm
// 2 - Prim's Algorithm

// These both Algo are <Greedy Algorithm>
// What is Greedy ALgorithm - 
// by choosing a local minima at each step you end up  
// getting a globally optimized/minima solution.


// Application of MST -
